# SpendeR (by Ustin)

Application to control your spends. Yep, another one. Just a simple crud to get acquitance with React Native and Firebase.

To run after cloning the repository put `.env` file to the root of the project (SpendeR folder) and add there line `SPENDER_DB_KEY=blabla` , where "blabla" is your firestore key.

Enjoy your day!
